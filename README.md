This is a collection of web applications I've created in PHP as part of my learning journey. 

Most of these ideas were inspired by or required for the class [Building Web Applications in PHP](https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-applications-php) by Dr. Charles Severance from University of Michigan. I would highly recommend checking out his classes as he presents things in a way that is both engaging and easy to learn.
